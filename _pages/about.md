# About Me

I am a 2nd-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of California, Irvine, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Padhraic Smyth](https://ics.uci.edu/~smyth/). My research is in:
- Model Selection and Evaluation of LLMs
- Fairness
- Online learning and Multi-armed bandit
- Human-AI interaction

I am interested in creating AI that is safe, fair, and trustworthy. I am a data curator/librarian for the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) and a member of the [Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology](https://create.ics.uci.edu/). 

I graduated from Pomona College, with a B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics. Previously, I have conducted research as part of the [SMALL NSF REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/) and the [play2PREVENT Lab](https://www.play2prevent.org/) at Yale School of Medicine.
