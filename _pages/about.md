# About Me

I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of California, Irvine where I am fortunate to be advised by Padhraic Smyth. My research is in:
- Improving the fairness and explainability of Machine Learning algorithms
- Missing data and causal inference: identification and estimation with data missing not at random

I graduated from Pomona College, with a B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics. In Summer '23, I participated in the [SMALL NSF REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/) at Williams College where I worked on improving the robustness and explainability of footwear impression matching for forensics in collaboration with [CSAFE](https://forensicstats.org/). I have conducted research on missing policing data with [Prof. Jo Hardin](https://hardin47.netlify.app/). I was also a research assistant with the [play2PREVENT Lab](https://www.play2prevent.org/) at Yale School of Medicine.
